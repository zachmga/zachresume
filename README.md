## Assignment 6

In part 1, you'll generate a static website using Hugo to display your resume. You'll edit your resume by updating YAML files instead of writing HTML. To see a sample resume site, please follow this link:
https://plankton-app-fhkab.ondigitalocean.app/ 

In part 2, you'll deploy your website to DigitalOcean's App Platform. 

Along the way, you'll learn a little more about Docker Compose, Git Submodules, and Platform as a Service. 

We'll be using entirely open source code for our static website (including the theme that we'll use to generate our resumes.)

Your deliverable for this assignment is a link to the static webiste where your resume is hosted. The link will be provided in App Platform. Please copy and pasted the link into the D2L Submission box. Your URL will look like the one posted above. You'll have a unique subdomain followed by `.ondigitalocean.app/`
